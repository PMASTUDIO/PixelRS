# PixelRS - Frontend framework

## Purpose

The purpose of PixelRS is to allow for agile frontend coding that deploys everywhere, with a new and fresh paradigm free from HTML / CSS / JS.

## Principles

- No HTML / CSS / JS except from third-party scripts
- Automatically Mobile-First
- Easy to write interfaces: Declarative syntax sugar
- Compiled to minified HTML / CSS / JS or WebAssembly
